Documentation of REACH-SA output data


REACH_SA/results/concentrations
baseline_molar: baseline molar concentrations of total nitrate, free ammonium, particulate nitrate (used for NH3 and NOx 
                marginal social cost scripts)
calibrated_conc: mass concentrations (ug/m3) of
		 H2SO4: sulfuric acid
                 NO3: nitrate
                 NH4: ammonium
                 SOA: secondary organic aerosols
                 PM: primary PM2.5
                 PM_25: total PM2.5 (sum of above species)
uncalibrated_conc: mass concentrations (ug/m3) of PM2.5 species prior to calibration

REACH_SA/results/matrices
Source-receptor matrices for each PM2.5 precursor and emissions height (ground, elevated)
Every row corresponds to a source location (list of sources are in emissions folder)
Every column responds to a receptor location 
Units are ug/m3/tonne

REACH_SA/results/social_costs
For each PM2.5 precursor file
census_id: 4 digit identifier created for each location
geo_name: location name
lon, lat: geometric centroids of each location
country: country name
poll: pollutant
emis: annual emissions in metric tonnes
eff_height: effective height (metres)
mort_pertonne: marginal social costs in mortalities per tonne
