Documentation of REACH-US output data

REACH_US/results
- Folder contains results for REACH-US with the 2017 National Emissions Inventory

REACH_US/additonal_outputs
- Folder contains results for REACH-US with the 2005 National Emissions Inventory
- Folder descriptions and file outputs mirror the REACH_US/results folder

REACH_US/results/concentrations
baseline_molar: baseline molar concentrations of total nitrate, free ammonium, particulate nitrate (used for NH3 and NOx 
                marginal social cost scripts)
calibrated_conc: mass concentrations (ug/m3) of
		 H2SO4: sulfuric acid
                 NO3: nitrate
                 NH4: ammonium
                 SOA: secondary organic aerosols
                 PM: primary PM2.5
                 PM_25: total PM2.5 (sum of above species)
uncalibrated_conc: mass concentrations (ug/m3) of PM2.5 species prior to calibration
eval_stats.csv: evaluation metrics for PM2.5 species

REACH_US/results/matrices
Source-receptor matrices for each PM2.5 precursor and emissions type (egu, nonegu and ground)
Every row corresponds to a source location (list of sources in are in emissions folder)
Every column responds to a receptor location (i.e all counties in the US)
Units are ug/m3/tonne
To match the matrices with the emissions file for each pollutant, stack matrices in this order: egu, nonegu, ground

REACH_US/results/social_costs
For each PM2.5 precursor file
GEOID17: county ID code
facility_id: facility id for egus
facility_name: facility name for egus
lon, lat: facility coordinates for egus, population-weighted centroids for other source types
emis: annual emissions in metric tonnes
stkhgt: stack height in metres
stkdiam: stack diameter in metres
stktemp: stack temperature in Kelvin
stkvel: stack velocity in metres/second
sector: egu, non-egus, or ground-level
type: elevated (egu and non-egus) or ground-level
tribal_fips: tribal ID code for applicable locations
poll: pollutant
marginal_damage: marginal social cost ($/tonne)
